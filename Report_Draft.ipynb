    "# Evaluation of Success Factors at Utah High Schools\n",

    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "While the success of a high school is typically measured by graduation rate and standardized test scores, the reality of a typical studentâ€™s education may be influenced by a multitude of factors including economic factors, class sizes, teacher pay, and more. Our project examines two separate metrics for school success: the average ACT score and the graduation rate for a given school. We investigated what factors are most highly associated with school success in order to suggest future causality research about those highly correlated factors. Ultimately, we hope schools will be able to use this data in order to better serve the educational needs of their students.\\\n",
    "Our primary source of data was the Utah State Board of Education (USBE)  [1], which publishes yearly district- and school-level data. In particular, we used the datasets that track ACT scores, graduation rates, median class sizes, enrollment demographic data, and graduation rates. Our data focuses on the 2021 and 2022 school years, as this is the most recent ACT score data available. We used exclusively school-level data for our project and focused only on schools with 11th- and 12th-grade students.\\\n",
