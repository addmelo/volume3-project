    "While the success of a high school is typically measured by graduation rates and standardized test scores, the reality of a typical student’s education may be influenced by a multitude of factors including economic factors, class sizes, teacher pay, and more. Our project examines two separate metrics for school success: the average ACT score and the graduation rate for a given school. We investigated what factors are most highly associated with school success in order to suggest future causality research about those highly correlated factors. Ultimately, we hope schools will be able to use this data in order to better serve the educational needs of their students.\\\n",
    "Several studies have explored this field. Walden University delved into the impact of class size on student success, yielding inconclusive results [1]. East Tennessee State University conducted research on the correlation between per-pupil expenditure, ACT scores, and graduation rates, concluding that graduation rates increased while ACT composite scores remained unaffected [2]. In 2022, the Canadian National Library of Medicine published a study on the various psychological, physical, and environmental factors that predict student performance in the long run [3]. In contrast, due to the limitation of our data, our research focus was solely at a school-level analysis with the hope of finding factors to predict average school performance.\\\n",
    "Our primary source of data was the Utah State Board of Education (USBE) [4], which publishes yearly district- and school-level data. In particular, we used the datasets that track ACT scores, graduation rates, median class sizes, and enrollment demographic data. Our data focuses on the 2021 and 2022 school years, as this is the most recent ACT score data available. We used exclusively school-level data for our project and focused only on schools with 11th- and 12th-grade students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our paper is structured as follows: we detail our data cleaning procedure; use a logistic regression to model graduation rate data; then use standard OLS, Lasso, and Ridge regressions; and summarize our findings. We chose to use these models because our study focuses on regression problems rather than classification problems. Additionally, we note that while ACT data is technically bounded (between 1 and 36), we considered linear regression appropriate because our dataset falls mostly within the middle third of the 1-36 range and there is considerable variance in our data."

    "# **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**\n",
    "\t\n",
    "   Our were drawn from many different datasets from the USBE that we merged together. First, we cleaned each of them individually. Missing values were addressed by replacing them with the average in that column. Non numeric data that we intended to use in regression were one hot encoded (such as whether a school belongs to a district or is a charter school). We also eliminated irrelevant variables that would not be useful for analysis, such as district names. Moreover, we eliminated most information about years other than 2022, which was the focus of our analysis, as described later. We also eliminate schools that do not have information on 11th and 12th graders, since they are not relevant to the research question.\n",
    "   Once each of these individual datasets were cleaned, we stitched them together using Stata, merging on the name of the school (which is also uniquely identified by an encoding in the data). Stata lends itself naturally to this task since it provides an excellent interface for merging and visualizing data. Merging all data sets together substantially reduces the sample size, from about 200 schools with ACT data to around 130 with all relevant data. Further datasets could be included, but at the consequence of further reducing sample size. Fortunately, it appears to be the case that the schools most likely to be in only some of the data sets are smaller, and therefore less relevant to the analysis once we weight by school size. \n",
    "   We also performed extensive feature engineering with Stata. For instance, we replaced several variables that tracked the number of students in a school with a given race or characteristic with percentages, so that they would be comparable across schools. We created one hot encodings for a number of variables, and we also created new variables by summing over other ones to provide additional options for independent variables to be used in regression. An example of this was to create a variable measuring the percentage of a school that was a racial minority, created by adding up all of the students who were not white. Finally, we renamed variables to have cleaner and more intuitive names for ease of use. A brief example of cleaning one of the raw datasets is given below, an interested reader can see the supplementary .do file for the data merging.\n"

Our model was weighted by student population to avoid smaller schools being over-represented. Additionally, we regularized our model. Our results are as follows:"

    "Since ACT is a standardized test and standards for graduation rates vary across schools, we performed the majority of our regression treating ACT scores as the dependent variable corresponding to school success. We performed a regression treating the 2021 ACT data as an independent variable and the 2022 data as a dependent variable and found that the coefficient value was 0.89 even with no other control variables (besides a constant). If we weight by the number of juniors and seniors at the school then the coefficient increases to 0.999 - so the schools with the most consistent scores are the larger ones, which is what we would expect. This means that the prior year's average ACT score is an excellent predictor of how a school will perform this year. Because of this, we concluded that average ACT scores are mostly independent of what specific students are taking the test, and highly dependent on the school the students go to. Furthermore, we concluded that using the 2022 ACT data alone as the dependent variable was a valid measure of school success. Visual representations below show that the spread of ACT scores in the sample is significant and somewhat bell shaped, as well as the persistence of ACT scores from year to year. "

    "# Conclusion and Ethics\n",
    "Our dataset was fairly limited. We only analyzed Utah high schools, but a future analysis would include similar data at a national level. Furthermore, more specific county level data from the US census could be used to address some of the complexities of demographic data. Despite limited data, we successfully identified an area of future research for exploring success factors for Utah’s schools. Our analysis does not imply a causal relationship between our explanatory and target variables, but it can be a starting point for further analysis designed to uncover a causal effect.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Research suggests that quality K-12 education is a proven pathway out of generational poverty, especially for minority students[6]. Unfortunately, the ERIC finds that those minority students that benefit so much from a quality education are typically underserved with fewer educational resources leading to worse educational outcomes [7]. Our analysis suggests that schools’ average ACT performance is strikingly associated with the underlying demographics of the student body. Because of this, we suggest that further investigation be done into what causes these inequities. We repeat the age-old caution that correlation does not imply causation. This association is not cause to try to exclude or otherwise discriminate against underserved demographics. Demographics are complex and multifaceted, and using strict proportions of demographics does not reflect the nuanced reality of culture, language, mobility, family structure, economic status, and other pertinent reasons for this inequity. This correlation may be rooted in a multitude of factors. For example, the ERIC also investigated differences of help-seeking behavior among different demographics and advocates for students to take control and responsibility for their choices in the learning environment [8]. Closing the gaps of racial inequity is a formidable problem, and our analysis serves to say that it is still a clear and present problem that needs to be addressed in Utah's schools. Nevertheless, addressing these disparities is clearly essential in helping schools successfully serve the diverse needs of their students.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, comparison between the metrics of graduation rates and ACT scores reveals that ACT scores serve as a better way to measure a school’s success. The heavy incentivization of graduation rates seems to often serve to the detriment of students. Instead of helping students to graduate, graduation standards have instead been lowered to the point of being almost entirely predicted by simple attendence. School should serve the diverse needs of their students, and unfortunately the proxy goal of high graduation seems to not serve very well to helping schools accomplish their true goal. This perhaps suggests a reevaluation of graduation standards throughout the state as well as their use as a proxy goal for schools. It also speaks to the efficacy the ACT and other standardized testing for evaluation of schools.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, although quality K-12 education demonstrably helps minority students escape poverty, systemic inequities in educational outcomes among different demographics exist throughout Utah's schools. This topic requires further investigation as well as a shift from solely prioritizing graduation rates to more nuanced metrics like ACT scores in evaluating educational outcomes.\n",
